Omar was elected on November 5, 2019 and sworn in as City Commissioner of the City of Philadelphia on January 6, 2020. Omar remains committed to empowering all Philadelphians to participate in the voting process by tackling voter apathy and educating communities about the importance of civic engagement.

Prior to serving as City Commissioner, Omar focused his career on advocacy roles in many sectors, including working for the Office of State Senator Vincent Hughes, the Nathaniel Sabir Memorial Scholarship Fund, Citizens for State Representative Louise Williams Bishop, the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania and as a union construction worker. Through grassroots engagement in barbershops and community centers, Omar created voter education campaigns to highlight the importance of registering to vote, the impact of elections and the threat of voter suppression. Most notably, Omar is the architect of the popular Vote Philly Vote campaign for the 2018 Midterm Elections. For his volunteer service to Philadelphia, Omar has been honored by the Ducky Birts Foundation and former Congressman Robert Brady for Recognition & Achievement of Vote Philly Vote, and he received the Lucien E. Blackwell Guiding Light of the Community Award.

Omar won a judgeship in the state of Pennsylvania. Although the Traffic Court was abolished in 2013, just prior to the start of Omar's tenure, the huge margin of his Democratic primary victory showed the reach of his passion and support.

Omar is a husband, father of 6 children and a lifelong Philadelphian. He is a graduate of Cheyney University and attended the Small Business Education Program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
