The Philadelphia City Commissioners are a three member bipartisan board of elected officials in charge of elections and voter registration for the City of Philadelphia. Each Commissioner is elected to serve a four-year term that coincides with the municipal election cycle for Mayor and City Council.

These are the three current City Commissioners:

**City Commissioner Lisa M Deeley (D)**  
 **City Commissioner Al Schmidt (R)**  
 **City Commissioner Omar Sabir (D)**

The Commissioners set and enforce department policies to administer voter registration and conduct elections in accordance with federal and state voter registration and election laws.
