You can register to vote through the Pennsylvania Department of State's [online application](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx). Before you begin, be sure to have your Pennsylvania driver's license or PennDOT ID card handy. If you don’t have one, there are other options. Once you submit your online application, it will be forwarded to the appropriate county voter registration office for processing.
